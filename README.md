# Understanding-Scala

This Post is related to my learning experience of Scala

* Scala needs no explanation but my defination of Scala goes something like this-  
> __ Scala is a bond between Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming.__
> __ With Object Oriented concepts you can lean into functional Programming as much as or little as you'd like__
> __ Scala compiles the Java byte code and runs on JVM.__
