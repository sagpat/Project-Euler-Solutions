# Understanding-Scala

This Post is related to my learning experience of Scala

* Scala needs no explanation but my defination of Scala goes something like this-  
 *Scala is a bond between Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming.*  
 *With Object Oriented concepts you can lean into functional Programming as much as or little as you'd like*  
 *Scala compiles the Java byte code and runs on JVM.*
