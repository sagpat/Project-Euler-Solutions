# Understanding-Scala

This Post is related to my learning experience of Scala

* Scala needs no explanation but my defination of Scala goes something like this-
_ Scala is a bond between Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming._
_ With Object Oriented concepts you can lean into functional Programming as much as or little as you'd like_
_ Scala compiles the Java byte code and runs on JVM._
